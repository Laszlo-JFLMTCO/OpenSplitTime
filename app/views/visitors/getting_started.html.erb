<h4>
  Creating or importing your first event
</h4><br/>
<p> 1. Sign up!</p>
<p> 2. Create a <%= link_to "new Course", new_course_path %>. (You can use your existing Course for future races.)</p>
<p> 3. If your event will be part of a recurring series, create a <%= link_to "new Race", new_race_path %>.</p>
<p> 4. Create a <%= link_to "new Event", new_event_path %>.</p>
<p> 5. From your Event page, add Splits manually or import them. <strong>You must have
  one start split and one finish <%= link_to "split", split_info_path %>.</strong> You may have as
  many <%= link_to "waypoint", split_info_path %> splits as you like. If you like, add Location info. The whole process will take
  some time, but remember that you can reuse your splits for future events.</p>
<p> 6. Add your racers' information manually or import it. To avoid duplication, your racers' information is stored as
  "efforts" and then reconciled with our participant database. You can always add or change racer information at race
  time or afterwards.</p>
<p> 7. Use OST Live to track your racers on the course. Data is available to the public instantly as you enter it.</p>
