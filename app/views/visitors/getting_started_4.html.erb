  Formatting your spreadsheet for import

<p>
  OpenSplitTime makes it easy (ok, at least reasonably doable for mere mortals) to import your data into the system. To
  start, you'll need to get your data into either Excel format (.xls or .xlsx) or comma-separated (.csv) format. Data is
  imported in two
  steps: Split import and Effort import.
</p>
<p><strong>Split import</strong></p>
<p>
  Make sure you have a single header row containing the names of your columns. Columns related to your
  participants' personal information must be on the left starting in column A. Splits and time data must be to the
  right. OST detects the separation point by looking for a column named "Start". All columns to the left of the "Start"
  column are assumed to contain personal information field names in the header and data below. The "Start" column and
  all columns to the right of it are assumed to contain Split names in the header and Split Time data below.
</p>
<p>
  Every Split must have a distance from start before it can be saved to the database. To make automated import
  possible, you will need to insert a second header row immediately below your first header row. This second row must
  contain the word "distance" in the first cell (cell A2 for Excel users) and must contain split distances from start
  immediately below the split names. If distances are in units other than miles, you will need to indicate the units in
  the second cell of your second header row (cell B2 for Excel users). OST curretly understands "kilometers," "km," and
  "meters."
</p>
<p>
  If you have just start and finish Splits, it's easier to just enter them manually. If you have more than four or five
  waypoints, you may want to import them.
</p>
<p>
  After importing or manually entering your Splits, you will need to associate them with your Event by clicking the
  "Associate splits" button in your Event view.
