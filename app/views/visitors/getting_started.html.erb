<h4>
  Creating or importing your first event
</h4><br/>
<p> 1. Sign up!</p>
<p> 2. Create a <%= link_to "new Course", new_course_path %>. (You can use your existing Course for future races.)</p>
<p> 3. If your event will be part of a recurring series (like an annual race), create
  a <%= link_to "new Race", new_race_path %>.</p>
<p> 4. Create a <%= link_to "new Event", new_event_path %>.</p>
<p> 5. From your Event page, add Splits manually or import them. <strong>You must have
  one start split and one finish <%= link_to "split", split_info_path %>.</strong> You may have as
  many <%= link_to "waypoint", split_info_path %> splits as you like. To add interest and function, tag your splits with
  Location info. The whole process will take
  some time, but remember that you can reuse your splits for future events run on the same course.</p>
<p> 6. Add your racers' personal information (names, ages, contact info) manually or import it. To avoid duplication,
  your racers' information is stored as
  "efforts" and you will be asked to reconcile it with our participant database. You can always add or change racer
  information at any
  time, inclding after the event is finished.</p>
<p> 7. If this is a planned event that will happen in the future, use OST Live to track your racers on the course. Data
  is available to the public instantly as you enter it.</p>
<p>or</p>
<p> 7(again?). If this is an event that happened in the past and you have the data somewhere in gmail, or sharing a
  thumb drive in a drawer with the Sword of Many Truths, or scribbled in a notebook in your basement, dust it off and enter it using our handy tools.</p>
