module Interactors

  # Some time data is entered based on military time, and in that case the absolute time
  # (as opposed to the elapsed time stored in the database) is more likely correct if the
  # two conflict. If an effort's start split_time is non-zero, we need to make it zero
  # and change effort.start_offset to account for the shift. But if we want existing absolute times
  # (other than the start split_time) to remain the same, we need to counter the change in offset
  # by subtracting a like amount from time_from_start in all later split_times for that effort.

  # This Class expects to receive an effort with included split_times and splits.
  # The non-zero starting split_time cannot be persisted, as it would not pass validations.
