OpenSplitTime
================

OpenSplitTime is a site for endurance athletes, fans and families, race directors, volunteers, support crews, and data geeks. Our purpose is simple: to make it easy to collect endurance event data, play with it, plan with it, safely archive it, and never worry about it again. 

The site is built and maintained by OpenSplitTime Company, a Colorado nonprofit corporation. If you find the website useful, motivating, entertaining, or strangely beautiful, please consider making a small [donation](https://www.opensplittime.org/donations) to help us keep the doors open. OpenSplitTime Company is registered with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service as a 501(c)(3) charitable organization. Your donations are probably tax deductible (but if you have any question you should ask your tax advisor about that stuff).

Our software engine is open source. If you have a suggestion for the site, or you are a software engineer and would like to help with development, or if you are a race director or data geek and would like to be a beta tester, please [contact us](mailto:mark@opensplittime.org) and let's talk.

OpenSplitTime is developed and maintained by endurance athletes for endurance athletes.

Ruby on Rails
-------------

This application requires:

- Ruby 2.3.3
- Rails 5.1.4

Learn more about [Installing Rails](https://gorails.com/setup/osx/10.12-sierra).

Getting Started
---------------
### Setup Local Environment
**Ruby**

1. Install Homebrew http://brew.sh/
1. Clone the repository to your local machine by [forking the repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)
2. `$ brew update`
3. `$ brew install rbenv`
4. `$ cd` into your local `OpenSplitTime` directory
5. `$ rbenv init` For any questions around setting up rbenv see https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv
6. `$ rbenv install 2.3.3`
7. `$ rbenv local 2.3.3` to make sure this is correct run `$ rbenv verision`
8. `$ rbenv rehash` then restart the terminal session

**Rails and Gems**

1. `$ gem install bundler` You should not need to `sudo` this if it says "permission denied" [rbenv is not setup correctly](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv/issues/670)
2. `$ gem install rails`
3. `$ brew install postgres`
3. `$ bundle install`

*if running into weird errors first try `$ rbenv rehash` and restart your terminal*

**Database**

1. Start your local DB `$ brew services restart postgres`
2. `$ rake db:setup` to get local data
3. `$ rails s` to start the server
4. Type `localhost:3000` in a browser
5. You can also locally import a sample race by downloading [Hardrock 2015](https://github.com/SplitTime/OpenSplitTime/raw/master/hardrock2015.xlsx)

*Test Users*
```
| Role  | Email              | Password |
| ----- | ------------------ | -------- |
| user  | tester@example.com | password |
| admin | user@example.com   | password |
```

*Postgres Search*

OpenSplitTime relies on metaphone searching using a Postgres add-on function. The function is available in the migrations, but because of fundamental changes in database structure, it is no longer possible to run all migrations using the existing codebase, so your dev and test databases will need to be set up using a `db:schema:load` strategy, like `rails db:setup`. After setting up your dev and test databases, you will need to run the following SQL query directly against the database:
```
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION pg_search_dmetaphone(text) RETURNS text LANGUAGE SQL IMMUTABLE STRICT AS $function$
  SELECT array_to_string(ARRAY(SELECT dmetaphone(unnest(regexp_split_to_array($1, E'\\s+')))), ' ')
$function$;
```
This is a one-time operation for each database.

**AWS**

OpenSplitTime relies on Amazon Web Services for file import and storage and for SNS (email and text) communications. To take full advantage of these, you will need AWS credentials loaded into your `.env` file, specifically:
```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_access_key
AWS_REGION=your_aws_region
S3_BUCKET=your_aws_bucket
```
Use your own credentials or contact us if you would like to use the dev group's credentials.

**Pusher**

OpenSplitTime uses Pusher for messaging with workers and to notify Live Entry operators of times that need attention. Specifically, you will need to add the following to your `.env` file:
```
PUSHER_APP_ID=xxx
PUSHER_KEY=xxx
PUSHER_SECRET_KEY=xxx
```
Contact us for the dev team's Pusher credentials.

**Sidekiq and Redis**

OpenSplitTime relies on Sidekiq for background jobs, and Sidekiq needs Redis. Install Redis using the simple instructions you'll find at [redis.io](https://redis.io). Run your Sidekiq server from the command line:

`$ sidekiq`

You'll know you did it right when you see the awesome ASCII art.

**ChromeDriver**

Some integration tests rely on Google ChromeDriver. You can install it in Mac OS X with `brew install chromedriver` or your preferred package manager for Linux or Windows.

Support

Create an [issue](https://github.com/SplitTime/OpenSplitTime/issues/new) with label `support` and we will try and help as best we can!

Contributing
-------------

We love Issues but we love Pull Requests more! If you want to change something or add something feel free to do so. If you don't have enough time or skills start an issue. Below are some loose guidlines for contributing.

### Pull Requests

Writing code for something is the fastest way to get feedback. It doesn't matter if the code is a work in progress or just a spike of an idea we'd love to see it. Our testing is weak we know. But it's something we value. If adding a new feature please consider adding tests for it. :heart:

### Issues

Be detailed. They only person who knows the bug you are experiencing or feature that you want is you! So please be as detailed as possible. Include labels like `bug` or `enhancement` and you know the saying a picture is worth a thousand words. So if you can grab a screenshot or gif of the behavior even better!
