<h3>About OpenSplitTime</h3>
<hr>
<p>
  OpenSplitTime is a site for endurance athletes, fans and families, race directors, support crews, and data geeks. Our
  purpose is simple: to make it easy to collect endurance event data, safely archive it, play with it, plan with it, and
  never worry about it again. If you are a race director, feel free to upload your data! Instructions for creating a new
  event (including formatting your Excel or CSV data file) may be found <%= link_to "here", getting_started_path %>.
</p>
<p>
  Your data will always be freely available to you and to your race participants. This site is supported exclusively by
  user donations. Sensitive data is carefully controlled and restricted to authorized viewers. You can download, modify,
  or delete your data whenever you like. As a race director, you need fewer hassles. We hope this site makes your life
  a bit easier.
</p>
<p>
  The site is operated by OpenSplitTime Company, a Colorado nonprofit corporation. If you find the website useful,
  motivating, entertaining, or strangely beautiful, please consider making a
  small <%= link_to "donation", donations_path %> to help us keep the doors
  open. OpenSplitTime Company is registered with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service as a 501(c)(3) charitable
  organization. Your donations are probably tax deductible (but you should always talk to your tax advisor about that
  stuff).
</p>
<p>
  Our software engine is open source. If you have a suggestion for the site, or you are a software engineer and would like to
  help with development, or if you are a race director or data geek and would like to be an alpha tester,
  please <%= mail_to "mark.oveson@gmail.com", "contact us" %> and we'll work something out.
</p>
<p>
  OpenSplitTime is developed and maintained by endurance athletes for endurance athletes.
