  Races, courses, events, what the heck?

<p> Yes, we know, there is a fair amount of terminology here, and it can be a bit confusing at first. Here's a short
  description of the terms you need to know.</p>
<p><strong><%= link_to "Course:", course_info_path %></strong> The physical course on which your event is run, ridden, swum (swam?), flown, or climbed.</p>
<p><strong><%= link_to "Split:", split_info_path %></strong> A distance from the start of a Course at which a Split Time is recorded. Every split is either a start, a
  finish, or an intermediate point.</p>
<p><strong><%= link_to "Location:", location_info_path %></strong> The physical location of a Split.</p>
<p><strong><%= link_to "Event:", event_info_path %></strong> A single running of a race, ride, stage, or other...you know, event.</p>
<p><strong><%= link_to "Race:", race_info_path %></strong> An administrative term for grouping recurring Events.</p>
<p><strong><%= link_to "Participant:", participant_info_path %></strong> Someone who has competed in at least one Event.</p>
<p><strong><%= link_to "Effort:", effort_info_path %></strong> The performance by a Participant in a single Event.</p>
<p><strong><%= link_to "Split Time:", split_time_info_path %></strong> A single time at which a Participant during an Effort passed through a given Split.</p>
<p>All this data is stored in a logical way with proper relations, which makes it possible to do just about
  anything you want with it. Some geeky people gave this a lot of thought. Trust us, it all works out.</p>
